Flight Dynamics Modelling
----------------------------

This package contains classes and routines for flight dynamics modelling.
To model the flight dynamics of an aircraft, the following classes are defined:

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: generated/

    ICARUS.Flight_Dynamics.disturbances
    ICARUS.Flight_Dynamics.perturbations
    ICARUS.Flight_Dynamics.state
    ICARUS.Flight_Dynamics.trim


Stability Analysis
-----------------------------

Around a given trim point, the stability derivatives are computed and the stability of the aircraft is analysed using Finite
Difference methods in the following package:
