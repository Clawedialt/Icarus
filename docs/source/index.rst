ICARUS's Aerodynamics
======================================

ICARUS is an aerodynamics package to  model analyze the performance of low speed aircraft using different computational methods and codes.
Inspired by a model aircraft designed by EUROAVIA Athens for the European Competion Air Cargo Challenge (ACC) that failed to fly because of
dynamic instability (hence the ICARUS name). This software is developed for it to be used as part of a more general optimization workflow 
that will use different fidelity levels to produce mission specific aircrafts.
