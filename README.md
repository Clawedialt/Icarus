# AircraftAnalysis

Code and Tools to analyze the performence of low speed aircraft using different computational methods and codes. Inspired by a model aircraft designed by EUROAVIA Athens for the European Competion Air Cargo Challenge (ACC). This software is developed for it to be used as part of a more general optimization workflow. 

## The project is under Work

## Tasks

- Create module to initialize, check and update Database of 2d and 3d polas
- Create airfoil class to store polars and be agnostic of code that generated them
- Create airplane class to model lifting surfaces
- Create master module to manage simulations that is aware of the different software needed to generate them
- Create stability module to move plane and calculate stability aeroderivatives and polars
