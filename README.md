# AircraftAnalysis

Code and Tools to analyze the performence of low speed aircraft using different computational methods and codes. Inspired by a model aircraft designed by EUROAVIA Athens for the European Competion Air Cargo Challenge (ACC). This software is developed for it to be used as part of a more general optimization workflow. 

## The project is under Work

## Tasks

- Update DB module to keep track of Planes as it does with airfoils

- Airplane Class
-- This class should be updated with more specific info on how airplane and surfaces are modeled. Lifting Surface class has to be added as well. 

- Create master module to manage simulations that is aware of the different software needed to generate them
- Create stability module to move plane and calculate stability aeroderivatives and polars
