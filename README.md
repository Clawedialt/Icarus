# AircraftAnalysis
## The project is under Work

Code and Tools to analyze the performence of low speed aircraft using different computational methods and codes. Inspired by a model aircraft designed by EUROAVIA Athens for the European Competion Air Cargo Challenge (ACC). This software is developed for it to be used as part of a more general optimization workflow. 

## How to run
This project depends on the following Software:
- OpenFoam (by OpenFoam.org)
- Foil2Wake (National Technical University of Athens Laboratory of Aerodynamics)
- XFoil (MIT)
- GenuVP (National Technical University of Athens Laboratory of Aerodynamics)

## Tasks
- Create master module to manage simulations that is aware of the different software needed to generate them
- Create stability module to move plane and calculate stability aeroderivatives and polars
- Create method for low order aeroderivative models
- Make makefile to run project
- Add GUI
